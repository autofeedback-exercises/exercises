    "As discussed previously any sample mean that we calculate is a random variable.  In order to make our result reproducible we must provide some information about the distribution whenever we quote a sample mean.  In previous exercises we have seen how we can provide this information on the distribution by proposing a confidence limit.  The process that we used to do this in those previous exercises involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating multiple random variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the `np.percentile` function to find a range that 90% of these random samples falls within.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could thus make our result by reprocible by noting that if our colleague was sampling the same distribution as us he should obtain a result that falls between the 5th and 95th percentile of our distribution of results with a probablity of 90%.\n",
    "\n",
    "To complete this exercise I want you to apply this idea for quoting confidence limits on a sample mean.  To complete the exericse you will need to complete the following functions in `main.py`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `sample_mean` should take in a single number `n`.  This function should return a sample mean that is calculated by adding `n` uniform random variables that lie between 0 and 1 together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `limit` should take in two numbers `n` and `m`.  This funciton should generate `m` sample means and store them in a NumPy array.  Each of these sample means should be calculated by adding together `n` uniform random variables that lie between 0 and 1.  This function should then return three numbers.  The first of these numbers `lower` should be the 5th percentile of the distribution of sample means that were generated.   The second of these numbers `median` should be the median of the sample means that was generated.  The final number `upper` should be the 95th percentile of the distribution of sample means.\n"

In this exercise, we are going to see how easy this realisation makes the process of calculating error bars.\n",

In addition, you should also compute the 5th and 95th percentiles for the distribution that mean was sampled from.  These two quantities should be retuned as `lower` and `upper`.
