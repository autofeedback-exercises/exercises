    "The random variables that have been introduced in previous blocks contain parameters.  For example, the Bernoulli random variable has a parameter $p$, the binomial random variable has two parameters $n$ and $p$ and the uniform random variable has two parameters $a$ and $b$.  Many stochastic models have parameters that can be varied by the modler like these.  When we are investigating such models an interesting exercise is to draw a graph that shows how the output of the model changes as the parameter is changed.  In other words, we draw a graph showing the value of the dependent variable (the random variable) on the y-axis and the independent variable (the parameter) on the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the model is stochastic drawing these graphs is slightly more complicated as we must include estimates of the error on any random variables.  As you will see at the end of this series of exercises, you already know everything you need to know to estimate and plot these errors.  In other words, this weeks exercise are just consolidating material that you have already seen in a slightly different guise.\n",

    "# Simulating a gambler\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use what you have just learned about modelling a 1D random walk can be used to model how a gambler plays a game such as roulette in a casino.  The idea in such games is that the gambler places a small stake on each game.  Lets suppose this is a stake of one pound.  When the game is played the gambler will either loose their stake and the total amount of money he has will thus decrease by one unit.  Alternatively, he will win the game and in that case he wins back his stake and a prize, which we will set as one pound.  If he wins the game he will thus have one pound than the amount of money that he came in with.  As you can see if the gambler repeats this process of staking money and playing the amount of money he has will undergo a random walk in one dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importantly there is a difference between the gambler and the 1D random walk, however.  The gambler usually only has a finite amount of money to gamble with.  If he looses a large number of games he is therefore forced to stop playing.  Similarly, the gambler may also have some target for how much money he would like to win.  In other words, he should have some figure N pounds, which is more than the amouont of money he entered the casino with.  He will stop gambling once he has N pounds in his pocket.\n",
    "\n",
    "The amount of money that the gambler has is an example of a stochastic process.  A stochastic process is for want of a better description a time-dependent random variable. Furthermore, the amount of money the gambler has is an example of a special kind of stochastic process that is known as a Markov chain.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A question that might be of interest is whether the gambler leaves the casino with zero pounds or whether he leaves with N pounds.  We can answer this question by running a simulation of the gambler.  Essentially we start the gambler with `s` pounds and simulate the process of him playing the game only stopping once he has zero  or `n` pounds.  We can then set a random variable equal to 1 if he has 0 pounds and 1 if he has `n` pounds.  The following video explains how we can write a program to estimate this quantity."

    "We can use simulation to determine the likelihood the gambler has of loosing all his money when he repeatedly plays a game such as roulette.  As we have seen elsewhere it is straightforward to write programs to simulate the ammount of money the gambler has and that return the final outcome for the series of games played.  For instance, we can write a funtion that simulates a 1D random walk that stops once the walker enters state 0 or state n.  This function can also be made to return a 1 if the walker finishes in state 0 and a 0 if the walker finishes in state n.  As the return value for such a function is 0 or 1 what has been generated here is  a Bernoulli random variable.  The method via which this random variable is generated is more complicated than the typical method we have used for generating Bernoulli random variables but the return value is still a random variable that can only equal 0 or 1.  It is thus a Bernoulli random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "You know that a Bernoulli random variable has only one parameter `p`.  In this exercise we are thus going to learn how to estimate this parameter by performing a series of simulations of the walker.

You can thus calculate a sample mean and a sample variance from all the the Bernoulli random variables you will have generated.

As you have estimated this parameter by sampling you need to quote a confidence limit around your estimate using what you have learned about the variance of the sample mean from other exercises.  Your `sample_mean` function should therefore return three numbers.  `lower` is the lower extent of a 90% confidence limit on the estimate of the sample mean, `mean` is the value of the sample mean and `upper` is the upper extent for the 90% confidence limit.\n",

In other words, you can calculate a sample mean for a random variables for a number of different parameter values (along with the error on your estimate) and you can plot this estimate of the true mean on a graph.  Please remember that we have expressions for the true mean for all the random variables that you have studied in this module.  If you take this option you should include a line showing how the true expectation changes with the parameter value for comparison."
