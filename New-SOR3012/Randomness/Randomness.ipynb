The geometric random variable measures the number of trials that we have to perform until we get a success.  It thus stands to reason that to generate such a variable we will need to perform multiple Bernoulli trials and stop generating Bernoulli trials once one of them is equal to one.\n",

    "As I explain in the following video, we cannot use a for loop to generate a geometric random variable because, unlike the binomial random variables, we do not know how many trials we will have to perform in advance.
