    "# Good programming practise\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations on completing the last exercise.  Now that you understand how to set and use variables you can write computer programs to solve most of the problems that will come up in your maths course.  There is only one additional thing (logic) that you need to need to learn about and we will cover that later in this notebook. Once you have mastery over that idea you will be able to write programs that solve __all__ the maths problems you might encounter.  However, before we get to logic, we are going to learn how to apply the first rule of good programming.  This first rule states:\n",
    "\n",
    "__The more code you write the more mistakes you will make.__\n",
    "\n",
    "In response to this realisation, the people who develop programming languages have introduced a lot of programming commands that allow you to shorten the codes you write.  Learning these commands does not allow you to write programs that complete more mathematical tasks.  To be clear, __you can already write programs that complete all the tasks that will be introduced in the next few exercises__.    Using these new commands will, however, allow you to solve these problems using less code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how these commands work we are going to rewrite the code in below.  This code evaluates and prints the first 11 terms in the seven times table.^ The code is 23 lines long and 12 different variables are used within it.  By the time you complete all the exercise, we will have reduced this to four lines of python and we will have only three variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this first exercise, however, I  just want to check that you understand how the code works.  So, with that in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "__Modify the code below so that it outputs the first 11 numbers in the 13 times table.__\n",
    "\n",
    "^ *0 times 7 is maybe not the first number in the seven times table that you learned at school.  Trust me when I tell you that this is there for an important reason, which we will come to in due course.*\n"

    "At the end of the last task, you should have arrived at a code that looked something like the one shown below.  By using an array you have reduced the number of variables from 12 down to two and the number of lines of code from 23 down to 15.  This reduction was achieved by introducing a second type of variable - an array.  The net result of this is that although the symbol `table` refers to a single number the symbol `timesTable` refers to a list of 11 numbers.  These two variables are of different types.\n",
    "\n",
    "This trick of using symbols to refer to different things is called the object-oriented paradigm and it was not invented by computer scientists.  Mathematicians were using this idea well before computers were even invented!  In a mathematical derivation, for instance, we might use the symbols a and b to refer to scalars or we might use the symbols a and b to refer to vectors.  In both cases, we can write c = a + b.  What we would do to evaluate c is, however, dependent on whether a and b are scalars or vectors.  We can see a difference like this in the print statement for the code on the left.  The two commands:\n",

The second command, meanwhile, will print 11 numbers as the variable `timesTable` has been set equal to an array.  Notice also that, the 11 numbers output by this second command appear in square brackets to indicate that these 11 numbers are grouped together in an array.\n",
