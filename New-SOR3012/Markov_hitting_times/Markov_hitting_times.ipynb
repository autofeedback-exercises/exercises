For example, the binomial random variable can be used to model the number of sucesses in a set of identical trials, while the geometric random variable and gamblers ruin can be used to model the number of trials you perform until a particular event occurs.\n",

In the next part of the course we are thus going to start to introduce the theory of Markov chains that is a more abstract body of theory that can be used to reformulate many of the ideas we have encountered in this course.  We will see how, because this theory is more abstract, it is also more powerful and how it allows us to easily construct models that describe more elaborate scenarios.\n",
