We also learned that this variance is not going to be useful in terms of us calculating the error bars for our ensemble averages.

In other words, we are going to calculate N block averages over each of the M-frame blocks in our trajectory using:\n",

To do this you are going to first have to compute block averages over the first 100, second 100, third 100 and so on frames in the trajectory as you have done in previous exercises.  You are then going to have to compute the quantities above from these block averages.  The final value that you get for the average energy should be saved in a variable called `average` and the final value for the error should be saved in a variable called `error`.\n"
