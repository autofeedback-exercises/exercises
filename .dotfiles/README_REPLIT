TLDR: don't copy the .replit file from here. Simply add the line 

run = ["sh", ".lesson/runtest.sh"]

to the auto-generated .replit file

================================================================================

Replit have changed the way the configuration is built/read from the .replit
file.

As a result, the .replit file is much simpler, but it will likely also break if
you try to copy this file into your replits projects. I suspect that it will
break as soon as they update whatever python version they're currently using,
and all of the version numbering will change. 

Thus the simplest solution is simply to add the line

run = ["sh", ".lesson/runtest.sh"]

to whatever .replit file gets automatically generated when you spin up a new
project.
