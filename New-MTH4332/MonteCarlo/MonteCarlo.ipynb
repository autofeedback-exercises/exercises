    "where the sums run over all the microstates.  You also learned that the number of microstates scales exponentially with the number of particles and that using the expressions above to compute ensemble averages is thus too expensive in the vast majority of instances.  To resolve this problem the next exercise will discuss how we can approximate the ensemble average of the energy as:\n",

    "The theory behind a method known as Monte Carlo simulation offers a justification for this approximation.  The exercises below, therefore, explains how this numerical technique can be used to calculate (definite) integrals and how we can thus use it to calculate the ensemble average, which, when state space is continuous and is given by the following expressions:\n",

Obviously, the order in which we go through the squares when doing this doesn't matter.  Furthermore, if, instead of running through all the squares, we selected only N of the squares at random and ran the algorithm on only those squares we would, once we divided the number of squares whose centres were found to be inside the circle by N, obtain a number close to the value of the final integral.  The reason for this being that the ratio between the number of squares whose centre is inside the circle to the total number of squares is constant.\n",

It should then generates `N` pairs of x and y coordinates all of which lie within the unit square.  A test is then performed to determine whether or not each of these points is within the unit circle.  If the point is within the circle then the variable, `nin`, which measures how many of the generated points are within the unit circle, is incremented by one.  At the end of the code the final estimate for the area of the quarter-circle, `nin/N`, is returned.\n",

The code that I have written will output three estimates for the area of the circle and you should see that all three estimates are different.  (the relevant part of the output is the first line - the second line should contain a single 0).\n",

They are almost guaranteed to get different results because running the code involves generating random numbers.\n",

The reason for doing so is that if the two codes are the same then the distributions that Alice and Bob are sampling random numbers from should be the same.  By quoting error bars we provide information on the distribution and we can thus make a judgement as to whether the two results that Alice and Bob obtained are the same or not.\n",

Within this function, you should generate `M` estimates for the area of the quarter circle each of which should be computed for a random grid of `N` $(x,y)$ coordinates.

    "When we run Monte Carlo (or molecular dynamics) we __always__ need to make sure we quote the error bars.  If a Monte Carlo calculation is performed and no error bars are reported on the final result is not reproducible.  I am emphasizing this now as if you stay in this field, you will see many papers that use Monte Carlo and that do not quote error bars.  Not quoting error bars these error bars a good way of hiding the crappiness of your underlying simulations and getting to a publishable (but dubious) result.  Be warned!\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with the resampling scheme that we used to calculate the error bars in the previous exercise is that it is computationally expensive.  It is expensive because we had to compute multiple averages each of which was computed by generating $N$ randomly chosen coordinates.  For the exercise here, where generating each configuration is computationally cheap, this is not a big problem.  If we are doing computationally expensive things for each of the configurations we are generating this sort of resampling scheme is not an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final exercise, a computationally inexpensive way of computing the error bars will thus be introduced.  This new technique is based on the central limit theorem, which tells us that an average calculated from $N$ random variables (of most types) with expectation $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2$ is (to a good approximation) a sample from a [normal distribution](https://www.notion.so/Normal-random-variable-86cae0d838314a3cb8aead626dc6647e) with expectation $\\mu$ and variance $\\sigma^2/N$.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the final result that we get from a Monte Carlo code is an average computed from multiple random variables we can thus approximate it as a sample from a normal distribution.  Furthermore, we know the exact functional form for the probability density function for the normal distribution so we can use this function when quoting error bars on the calculated mean.\n",
