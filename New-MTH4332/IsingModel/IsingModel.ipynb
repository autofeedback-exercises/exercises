    "Before we try to implement a Monte Carlo code for simulating the Ising model we are going to first write a program to sample one of the 1D energy landscapes that you investigated\n",
    "using MD in the last batch of this exercises with the Monte Carlo algorithm that was discussed in the video.  With that in mind, I have written a function called Hamiltonian in the following cell.  This function takes the position of the particle and returns the energy.  As you can see the energy in this case is just a harmonic potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are going to write code that generates a graph that shows the series of $x$ values that are sampled by the Monte Carlo trajectory.  I will then test that you have implemented Monte Carlo correctly by determining if the series of random variables is sampling from the correct distribution.  I have started the process\n",
    "of writing this code for you by setting the inital position of the particle equal in the variable `pos`.  You will also see that I have set the variable `oldenergy` equal to the energy that the system has when the particle is at `pos`.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have then written a loop that will generate `nsamples` random variables using Monte Carlo and created NumPy arrays called `xvals` and `yvals` that will be plotted\n",
    "using Matplotlib.  __Your task is to fill in the code in this loop so that the array yval contains the frames that are generated by your Monte Carlo simulation.__\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps that need to be completed in the loop (and which you must code) are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to generate a new particle position `newpos`.  To generate this new position you a uniform continuous random variable, `U`, that is between -`maxshift` and +`maxshift and add it to `pos`.  You thus generate a new position by moving `pos` either left or right by a small (random) ammount.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You calculate the energy at the new position `newpos` by calling the function `hamiltonian`.  Save this new energy to a variable called `newenergy`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. If `newenergy` is less or equal to `oldenergy` then you __accept__ the move.  You thus set `pos=newpos` and `oldenergy=newenergy`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. If `newenergy` is greater than `oldenergy` then you calculate the following ratio:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tau = \\frac{e^{-\\beta E_2} }{ e^{-\\beta E_1} }\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E_2$ is `newenergy` and $E_1$ is `oldenergy` and $\\beta = \\frac{1}{k_B T}$. The variable `temp` contains the value of $k_B T$ that I will assume you have used in your code when I test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You then generate a second uniform random variable between 0 and 1, `Ua`, if `Ua` is less than the ratio you calculated in step 4 (r) then you accept the move and set `pos=newpos` and `oldenergy=newenergy`.  If it is greater then the move is rejected and no changes are made to the values of `pos` or `oldenergy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This 5 step process will then be repeated multiple times because it is in a loop.  The graph that is plotted will thus show the position the particle took in the accepted moves.  Whenever a move is not accepted you will see two consecutive points that have the same y-value."

If this integer is equal to N^2 your function should return the energy of a configuration in which all the spins point in the opposite direction to the one they point in `spins`.

To calculate the energy of this configuration you will need to use what you learned in the exercises on evaluating these spin hamiltonians.  The energy should be stored in a variable called `eng`.  You have also learned how to calculate the magnetisation in previous exercises.\n",

This variable determines the random move that should be performed.  If `move` is equal to `L*L` then the trial move involves flipping every spin.  If `move` is equal to any other value then the `spin[j,k]` is flipped.  You should set the variable `neweng` equal to the energy of the new configuration.  To complete this task you will need to use what you learned in the exercise that came just before the previous one.\n",

To complete this line of the code you will need to use what you learned in the first exercise on Monte Carlo that you completed.  The exercise where you used Monte Carlo to sample a harmonic potential.\n",

    "4. You need to update the `spins` array so that it contains the trial move when the trial move is accepted. If this updating of `spins` is not performed then we cannot determine the energy of the trial move when we start the new move on the next pass through the loop.  At this point you also need to determine the new value of the magnetisation.  Please note that you can quickly update the magnetisation from the old magnetisation in much the same way as you have learned to quickly recompute the energy.  You do not (and should not) sum all the elements of the `spins` array on every step\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You need to add code to accumulate the ensemble averages <M> and <M^2>.  I would use the variables `M` and `M2` to hold the numerators of these ensemble averages and `ns` to hold the denominator.  Please note that to pass the test you should only\n",
