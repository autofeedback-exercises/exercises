    "To calculate the radial distirbution function you need to adapt the code that you have previously learned to write to estimate the histogram.  The first step in calculating this function\n",

    "bin just as you have learned to ascribe other observables to bins in a histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a crucial difference between the process of calculating a histogram that you have gone through in previous exercises and the process of calculating a radial distribution function.  When you\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first loop in this code iterates over all the trajectory frames.  I then use the `atoms.get_all_distances` from ASE to calculate the distances between all the particles in the system.  This method returns\n",
    "an NxN NumPy array in which element i,j gives the distance between atom i and atom j.  The two inner loops in the code above iterate over the lower triangle of this (symmetric) matrix.  You need to add code\n",
    "to accumulate the histogram from the various `distance[i,j]` values that are iterated over.  Think carefully about the fact that the loop will iterate over only N(N-1)/2 of the distance elements of the matrix\n",
    "`distances`.\n",

    "2. The number of atoms in the system.\n",
    "3. The number of atoms that you would expect to find in an ideal gas that has the same volume and density as the bin.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you calculate a radial distribution function from an MD simulation the result you get is an estimate.  Consequently, as with everything else you have learned to calculate from MD simulations,\n",
    "you need to quote error bars on your estimate.  You can get these errors using the block averaging technique that we have seen elsewhere in this course.  Furthermore, when you work out the lengths\n",
    "of the blocks that are needed you use the same techniques as we have used in previous exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "__In this exercise you are going to generate a estimate of the radial distribution function along with the erorrs on this estimate of the distribution.__  I would like you to spit the data in the trajectory\n",
    "that I have provided into __five__ blocks.  You can calculate 5 separate estimates of the radial distribution function from these five blocks of data.  Each of these estimates of the radial distribution function\n",
    "should be calculated to a maximum distance of `maxd` and should use `nbins` bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you have calculated and normalised the five rdfs using what you learned in the previous exercise you should set the variable called `average` equal to the average of these five estimates of the rdf.  The variable\n",
    "called error should be set equal to the error for a 90% confidence limit on your estimate.  To set this array you will need to calculate the variance for each of the bins from your five estimates of the rdf.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variabels `average` and `error` that you will set (and that I test) should be NumPy arrays.  I have included code at the end of `main.py` that will plot the radial distribution function and the estimate of the errors for you.\n",
    "Notice that I use `plt.fill_between` as the rdf is a continuous function.  We thus do what we did in previous exericses and display the part of the xy-plane that this function passes through as a shaded area.\n"
