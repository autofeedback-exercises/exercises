    "In the previous set of programming exercises, you learned how we can calculate approximate values for integrals by using a method called Monte Carlo, which works by a set of random microstates and computing an average.  By far the most common way that Monte Carlo simulation is used when doing research in statistical mechanics is through a variant known as molecular dynamics (MD).  In this next set of programming exercises, you are thus going to learn the basics of how to set up and run a molecular dynamics calculation.\n",

    "In molecular dynamics calculations configurations are generated by solving Newtons equations numerically.  We are thus not generating random variables except when we set up the intial velocities of the particles.  However, the fact that the intial velocities are set randomly is what generates the randomness.  You can show that small differences in the initial velocities of the particles quickly accumulate.  Trajectories that are started from configurations that are very similar thus quickly diverge.  You can thus treat the observables that emerge from an MD simulation as if they are random variables and analyse any time series that emerge from an MD trajectory as if it is a sequence of random variables.\n",

    "The first thing you must learn in order to run MD is how to write a function to compute the potential energy for a configuration.

       "# Implementing thermostated MD\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know how an MD code is written and what the distribution of velocities for a system at a particular temperature is we should be in a position to implement a constant temperature MD algorithm.  As was already discussed in the previous sections a wide variety of different techniques can be used to couple the velocities of the atoms in the system with a heat bath.  In this exercise, we are going to learn about the so-called Langevin thermostat.  This thermostat works adjusting the velocities before and after the first step of the velocity Verlet algorithm using the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\delta$ is half the simulation timestep, $\\gamma$ is a parameter known as the friction of the thermostat and N(0,1) is used to indicate a sample from a standard normal random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The details as to how this expression is derived are beyond the scope of this module.  We can begin to understand how it works by looking at its structure.  The $e^{-\\gamma\\delta}$ in the first term, for instance, is less than one.  By multiplying the old velocity by this expression repeatedly we thus cause the old velocity to decay away to zero.  Ignoring the factor of $(1-e^{-2\\gamma\\delta})$ in the second term gives us the expression that we used to set the initial velocities of the atoms.  Consequently, if we use a very large time step, it is as if we are simply setting the velocities as we did in the first exercise. Notice last of all that the coefficients of the terms in the sum above are constant.  You can thus calculate these coefficients outside the main MD loop to improve computational efficiency\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, notice that by setting the coefficients of the second term equal to $\\sqrt{1-e^{-2\\gamma\\delta}}$ we ensure that the sum of the squares of the coefficients of $v_{old}$ in the first part and the value we would set for the initial velocity in the second part is one.  In other words, in setting the coefficients we are using Pythagoras theorem in some way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets now turn to what you need to do in order to complete the code.  As in the previous exercise, I have written a skeleton code for the MD algorithm that you need to fill in.  To complete this you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function called `potential` that computes the potential energy and the forces for each of the configurations you generate.\n",
    "2. Write a function called `kinetic` that calculates the instantaneous kinetic energy.\n",
    "3. Every 10 MD steps store the instantaneous values of the potential, kinetic and total energies in the lists called `p_energy`, `k_energy` and `t_energy`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you then need to complete the skeleton code that implements the dynamics.  In each loop this code should:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use the equation given above to modify the velocities.  When using the above equation in this step $\\delta$ should be set equal to half the simulation timestep.  This step is the first step in controlling the simulation temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Update the velocities, v, by a half timestep using:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Update the positions, x, by a full timestep using:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Recalculate the forces $F(t+\\delta)$ at the new position.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use the new values of the forces to update the velocities by another half timestep using:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use the equation given above to modify the velocities one more.  As in the first step $\\delta$ should be set equal to half the simulation timestep as you do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the algorithm I have just described is very similar to the velocity Verlet algorithm that you implemented in the previous exercise.  In this new algorithm, the steps of the velocity Verlet algorithm are just sandwiched between the initial and final steps that control the simulation temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the outline code, you will notice that I have created three variables to hold the positions (`pos`), velocities (`vel`) and forces (`forces`).  Notice that whenever you update the velocities, positions or forces in the velocity Verlet algorithm you never again need the old positions velocities or forces.  You thus can (and should) use these three matrices to hold the instantaneous positions, velocities and forces.  I have written some code that will keep track of the velocities the particle takes during the trajectory and that can be used to visualise what happens to the velocity as the calculation proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final result from the calculation should be a graph showing how the velocity of the particle changes with time during the simulation.  If the code has been implemented correctly you should see that the value of the velocity fluctuates around 0.  The variance of the distribution of velocities the particle takes during the simulation should be equal to the temperature.\n"

       "# Testing your implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "In this final exercise, I would like to finish by exploring how we can ensure that we have implemented the thermostat correctly.  I have already alluded the first test you should perform on any code in the previous exercise.  You should ensure that the average kinetic energy has a value that is consistent with the predictions of equipartition.  Equipartition states that a system with N momentum coordinates should have an average kinetic energy of Nk_BT / 2.  If the average kinetic energy does not fluctuate around this value then we know that our thermostat is implemented wrongly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing that needs to be checked is whether or not an appropriate conserved quantity has been conserved.  It is hopefully obvious that the total energy (i.e. the sum of the kinetic and potential energies) is not conserved when we run this sort of constant temperature molecular dynamics.  After all, energy is exchanged between the system and the reservoir whenever the thermostat changes the velocities of the atoms.  There is, however, no way that energy can leave the coupled system composed of the atoms and thermostat.  If we thus track how much energy is transferred from the atoms to the thermostat over the course of the simulation and add this to the total energy of the atoms this final quantity should be conserved.\n",
    "\n",
    "To check the energy is conserved we, therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Introduce a variable called `therm` and set its value equal to zero before our main MD loop.\n",
    "2. Before applying the equation for the thermostat below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "We compute the total kinetic energy of the particles and add it to the variable called `therm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then after applying the equation for the thermostat we compute the kinetic energy again and subtract it from `therm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice, furthermore, that this business of updating therm must be done twice during the main MD loop as the thermostat is applied at the start and end of each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final conserved quantity is computed by adding together the kinetic and potential energies of the particles and the variable called `therm`.  This quantity is conserved because, if `therm` is computed using the scheme described above, then this variable tracks the total amount of energy that has been transferred from the system to the thermostat's heat bath.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get you started on implementing a constant temperature MD code that checks for a conserved quantity I have written the outline code in the cell on the left.  As in previous exercises to complete this code you will need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Write a function called `potential` that computes the potential energy and the forces for each of the configurations you generate.\n",
    "* Write a function called `kinetic` that calculates the instantaneous kinetic energy.\n",
    "* Use your potential function to write code that uses the velocity Verlet algorithm to integrate the equations of motion.\n",
    "* Every 10 MD steps store the instantaneous values of the potential, kinetic and conserved quantity in the lists called `p_energy`, `k_energy` and `conserved`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the code is completed correctly a graph should be generated that shows that the conserved quantity does not change with time over the course of the simulation.  Small fluctuations in the value of the conserved quantity are inevitable due to machine error.  This quantity should not drift upwards or downwards with time, however.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will get an error about the graph being plotted with wrong data if you write an MD code in which the energy is not conserved.\n",

This first task is going to revise the material that was covered in the previous set of exercises on molecular dynamics simulation.  We will also review what you have learned about the method of block averaging.  The objective is to use molecular dynamics to calculate an estimate for the ensemble average of the energy.  As we are computing an estimate for the ensemble average for the energy, we must also compute suitable error bars for this estimate, and we will calculate these errors using block averaging.\n",
