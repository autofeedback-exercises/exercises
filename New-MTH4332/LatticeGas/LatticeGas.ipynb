In this case we are being told to construct a number by completing the following set of operations:\n",

The problem is that we have not developed an analytic expression by performing these programming exercises.  When we calculated the partition function we instead wrote a program that allowed us to calculate the value of the canonical partition function when the temperature and the magnetic field took on particular values.  In other words, the partition function we have learned to calculate is a single scalar and not an analytic function.  As it is not an analytic function we cannot extract values for the ensemble averages from it.\n",
