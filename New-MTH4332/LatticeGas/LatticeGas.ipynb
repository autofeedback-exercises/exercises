In these next three exercises I am going to check that you understand these ideas and that you are able to use them to enumerate all the microstates that a system of N particles that can each adopt M states can be in.\n",

This list of ones and zeros can also be converted to a single number if we think of each number as a binary digit.  Your task in these first two exercises is thus to review how we can write algorithms to convert numbers from one representation to another.  This algorithm will prove essential when it comes to enumerating all the microstates that a system can be within.\n",

It may sound conterintuitive by the set of symbols 3260 is not actually the number three thousand two hunder and sixty. Instead, it is a representation of that number.  In other words, the four digit number 3260 is actually a set of instructions for constructing a number from simpler parts.  In this case we are being told to construct a number by completing the following set of operations:\n",

    "We can use a similar idea to express the microstate for our system with N particles that can each be in one of two states using a single number.  As each particle can only be in the zero 0 or 1 state this representation of number does not use base ten as the basic components of the numbers - the states of our particles - cannot be in ten different states.  Each particle can instead only be in two distinct states.  We thus only have two symbols 0 and 1 available to us.  There is no way that the numbers 2 or 3 can be stored using a single particle.\n",

       "# The analytic derivations\n",
    "\n",
    "The method that I showed you in the last exercise for calculating the ensemble average for the energy as a function of temperature will (in theory) work for any system where each the individual particles can adopt one of a finite number of M distinct states.  In other words, this method will work for both interacting and non-interacting particles.  It is important to note, however, that using it is not really feasible when the number of particles in the system, N, is large.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some special cases we can also calculate an anlytic expression that gives the partition function in terms of the magnetic field strength H, the number of spins and the temperature T.  Deriving these expressions is certainly possibly for the non-interacting particles that you are studying in this exercise.  In this exercise, I am thus going to show you how we can use SymPy to calculate the partition function and the ensemble average for the energy analytically for these non-intracting systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to recognise when deriving these analytic expression is that if the particles are on a lattice and if they do not interact we can determine the N-particle partition function Z(N) from the one particle partition function Z(1) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The one particle partition function is easy to calculate as it is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the sum runs over all the M states the individual particles can be within and where E_i is the energy of the ith state the particle can be within.  Hence, for systems with the Hamiltonian that we have been studying in these exercises:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "where the individual particles can be in state s_n = -1 or s_n = +1 the one particle partition function is thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "so the N particle partition function is;\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq5.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have an analytic expression for the partition function for our system such as the one above we can easily calculate all thermodynmaic averages.  For example, we can calculate the ensemble average of the energy as a function of temperature from the function aboveusing:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](eq6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `main.py` file I have provided for this exercise, I have used Sympy and the expressions above to derive an analytic expression for the ensemble average of the energy as a function of temperature.  As you can see, Sympy can compute the partial derivaties that I need directly.  I can thus avoid doing tedious derivations using pen and paper (or I can use Sympy to check that I got the correct results from my tedious derivatives).\n",
    "\n",
    "The derivation that I have done is for the Hamiltonian that I have written in the third of the equations above.  I would like you to modify the `main.py` file and to derive an analytic expression for the ensemble average of the energy for a system of non-interacting particles that can each occupy three distinct states that have energies of 0, 1 and 3 units.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of my `main.py` file I have used NumPy and Matplotlib to draw a graph showing the analytic function for the ensemble average of the energy as a function of temperature.  To pass this exercise you will need to use the expression you derived using Sympy to redraw this graph.  You will pass once you have a graph that shows how the ensemble average of the energy for a system with 8 particles that can each be in the three states described above changes with temperature.\n"
