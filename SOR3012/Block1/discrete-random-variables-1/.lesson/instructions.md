# Generating random variables

Now that you are comfortable with the function below:

```python
myrandom = np.random.uniform(0,1)
```

See if you can use this function and what you learned about loops, lists and plotting last week.  Generate 100 uniform random variables that lie between 0 and 1.  You should plot 100 points in a graph.  
The y-coordinates of these points should be the values of your random variables.  The x-coordinates should 
be the numbers 1, 2, 3 and so on up to 100.  The x-axis label should be "Index" and the y-axis label should be "random variable".
