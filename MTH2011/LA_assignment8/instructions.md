LA assignment 8: computer questions

1. Let $\mathbb{C}^3$ be the standard 3-dimensional inner product space over $\mathbb{C}$ and let $T: \mathbb{C}^3 \to \mathbb{C}^3, \left(x,y,z\right) \mapsto \left(x,x+y,x+y+z\right)$

 
Cast $T$ as a matrix (pay attention to the requested variable names), determine its adjoint, and use these quantities to determine whether or not $T$  is Hermitian, unitary or normal.

2. Diagonalise the matrix 

$$B= \left(
\begin{array}{ccc}
1 & 2&0\\
0 & 1 & 2 \\
2 & 0 & 1 
\end{array}
\right)$$


to find a unitary matrix $U$, and a diagonal matrix $D$, such that $U^*BU=D$.
