TASKS

Q1. Set up and solve the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} 2x+3y = 3 \\ x -2y = 5 \\ 3x+2y = 7 \end{cases}$$

Ensure you use the variable names specified below

Q2. Set up and solve the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} x+2y-3z+2t = 2 \\ 2x +5y -8z +6t = 5 \\ 3x+4y-5z+2t = 4 \end{cases}$$

to give $x(t), y(t)$ and $z(t)$

Q3. Set up and solve the system of equations

$$\begin{cases} x^3y^2z^6 = 1 \\ x^4y^5z^{12}= 2 \\ x^2y^2z^5 = 3 \end{cases}$$
