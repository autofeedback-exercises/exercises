    "1. (3 marks): complete the code using the template provided, to produce a plot of the sum of the largest eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$, vs the largest eigenvalue of $C$ for 1000 pairs of randomly generated self adjoint matrices, $A$ and $B$. Submit this plot (on canvas), along with a sentence describing what is shown using the [$\\LaTeX$ template provided](https://www.overleaf.com/docs?snip_uri=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abrown41/testoverleaf/main/MTH2011_mini_project_1.zip).\n",
    "2. (4 marks): add to your document a properly constructed theorem describing the relationship between the two values plotted. Make sure to state this formally as a theorem (just as we did in the lectures).\n",
    "3. (5 marks): add to your document an explicit example of matrices $A$ and $B$ and how the sum of their largest eigenvalues and the largest eigenvalue of $A+B$ demonstrates the relationship of your theorem.\n",
    "4. (6 marks): extend all of the tasks to the corresponding minimum eigenvalues. That is, produce another plot, a second theorem and an example, that all describe how the sum of the lowest eigenvalues of $A$ and $B$, are related to the lowest eigenvalue of $A+B$.\n",
