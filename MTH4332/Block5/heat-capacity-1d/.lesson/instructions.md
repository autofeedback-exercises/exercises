# Heat capacity for 1D quantum harmonic oscillator

Your task for this exercise is to calculate the heat capcity for a single quantum harmonic oscillator as a function of temperature and to draw a graph
of this function.  When I test your code I assume that the hbar times omega value for your harmonic oscillator is equal to the variable I have 
called `frequency` in the `main.py` code that I have provided you with.  You will need to find the expression for the heat capacity of a quantum Harmonic
oscillator from the notes and resources that I have provided you (or derive the expression yourself) with for this task.  

Please ensure that you have a variable called `T` in your final `main.py` code.  This variable should be set equal to a NumPy array that contains the temperatures
at which you evaluated the heat capacity when you generated in the plots.  I use this variable when testing your code.  Please also set the x-axis and y-axis labels 
on your graph equal to "Temperature / natural units" and "Heat capacity / natural units" respectively.
