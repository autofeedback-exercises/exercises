    "In the previous exercise, we computed the Fourier sum for a function of one variable. In this exercise, we will extend this function to account for the solution of the heat equation, which depends on both space and time ($x$ and $t$).\n",

    "Recall that the Fourier sum which describes the solution of the heat equation is \n",
    "\n",
    "$$u\\left(x,t\\right)\\: = \\sum \\limits _{n=1} ^{N} B_n \\sin \\dfrac{n\\pi x}{l} \\,\\exp \\left(-\\dfrac{n^2\\pi ^2}{l^2} Kt\\right)$$\n",

    "1. it takes *five* input variables, `(Bn, x, l, t, K)` (make sure you get the order right):\n",

    "      * `x` is an array of values for the independent variable $x$ \n",

    "      * `t` is a single value for the independent variable $t$\n",
    "      * `K` is the diffusion constant from the heat equation\n",
    "2. returns the solution of the heat equation computed with the input variables, i.e. $u(x, t)$ as given in the equation above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the returned object is an array of the same length as `x`, which can then be plotted as a function of `x`. Thus, by varying the number of coefficients in the list `Bn` you may investigate the effect of including different numbers of terms in the Fourier sum, i.e. varying the value of $N$ in the summation. Or, by calling the function with different values of `t` you can produce plots of the solution at different times.  These are the two tasks labelled 2(a) and 2(b) in the project description."
