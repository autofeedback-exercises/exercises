If we want to find the decimal decomposition of a number larger than 9999,\n","   our function `decompose` won't work. For instance, for the number `12345`, we\n","   will get back `[12, 3, 4, 5]`, when in fact we should have `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.\n","2. To address this first problem we could just continue to add more\n","   `NumberOf...` functions. But this is inefficient. We would like to find a more\n","   streamlined way of solving this problem.\n","3. The approach is restricted to finding base-10 numbers, when in fact we could\n","   make it more general, and find e.g. the binary (base-2) representation of a\n","   number.\n","\n","Now that problem 2 has been solved, you need to extend the code to solve\n","problems 1 and 3.
