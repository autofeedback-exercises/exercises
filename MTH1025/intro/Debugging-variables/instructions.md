# Debug Variables

1. Run the code to see ny output/errors
2. Fix the code and any errors so that it does the following

---

- Define the variable `x` to have the value of $\dfrac{\pi}{3}$.

- Define the variable `y` to be $\sin x$.

- Define the variable `z` to be the product of `x` and `y`.

- Redefine `x` to be $\cos z$

- Print the values of `x`, `y` and `z` (on one line)
