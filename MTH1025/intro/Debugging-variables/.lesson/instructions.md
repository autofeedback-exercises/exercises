# Debug Variables

1. Run the code to see ny output/errors
2. Fix the code and any errors so that it does the following

---

- Define the variable `x` to have the value of ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{\pi}{3})
&nbsp;

- Define the variable `y` to be ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\sin(x))
&nbsp;

- Define the variable `z` to be the product of `x` and `y`.
&nbsp;

- Redefine `x` to be ![](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\cos(z))
&nbsp;

- Print the values of `x`, `y` and `z` (on one line)
