# Getting to grips with the IDE

Click on the file named 'main.py' in the file tree on the left. There you can enter python code.  For instance,try typing 

print('Hello World!')

When you have a piece of code you want to run, click 'run' at the top.  Any output of your code, including any errors, will appear in the terminal window, on the right hand side of the screen.

You can try printing the results of some mathematical operations as well e.g.

    print ( 7/ 1+6 )
    print ( 7/(1+6) )
    print ( 10 / 10**2 )
    print ( (10/10)**2 )

to get used to the way algebraic expressions should be typed in. Essentially it is the same as your calculator.

When you're done experimenting, remove all the code from `main.py`, and simply re-enter the code to print 'Hello World!' to screen. Click the 'run' button, at the top to make sure your code executes as expected. Once you're happy, click 'submit' in the top right, and you're done.
