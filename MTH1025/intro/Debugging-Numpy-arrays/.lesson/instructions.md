# Debug Arrays

1. Run the code to view any output/errors
2. Fix the code and any errors so that the code does the following

---

### Task 1

- define an array `x` which contains 10 values equally spaced between 0 and 1
- define a variable `x3` which is equal to the third element of the array `x`
- set the first element of `x` to -1



### Task 2

- define an array `y` which contains the values 2, 4, ..., 20
- define an array `y5` which contains just the first 5 values of `y` 

### Task 3


- define an array `z` which contains the elements of the array `y` squared 
- define a variable `zdiff` which is the difference between the first two elements of `z`
