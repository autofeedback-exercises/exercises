# Numpy Arrays
For each of the following expressions define a variable with the given name, and set the value accordingly.

The first one has been completed so you can see the required syntax

* $y=2x,$ for $x=1,2,3$

* $y1=4x^2 +6x+3,$ for $x=0,0.5,\ldots,6.0$

* $y2=-x^2 -1,$ for $x=0,0.5,\ldots,6.0$

* $x1= u \cdot \cos u,$ for 1000 values of $u$ between $-\pi$ and $\pi$

* $x2= \dfrac{u}{u+3},$ for 1000 values of $u$ between $-\pi$ and $\pi$

* Construct the array $a$ that contains the elements
 $$a_n = n(n+1),\, \mbox{ for }\, n=0,\,1,\,\ldots,\,99$$
