# Calculation_Basics
For each of the following expressions define a variable with the given name, and set the value accordingly.
The first one has been completed so you can see the required syntax

* $q0 = \sin\left(\dfrac{\pi}{4}\right)$

* $q1 = \dfrac{3^4+7^5}{36^1-1}$

* $q2 = \dfrac{4}{3}\pi r^3$ where $r=3^{1/5}$

* $q3 = \sin\left(\dfrac{5\pi}{6}\right)$

* $q4 = \sin^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{5}\right)+\cos^2\left(\dfrac{\pi}{5}\right)$

* $q5 = e^5$

* $q6 = \log_{10} \left(10^3\right)$
