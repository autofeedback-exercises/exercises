# Plotting 

The data sets to be ploted have been defined for you: don't edit them!

1. Plot the values of y against x using a solid red line
2. Plot the values of z against x using a dashed blue line
3. Label the x-axis 'Time (s)' and the y-axis 'Amplitude (cm)' 
4. Give the chart the title 'Harmonic motion with differing starting phases'.
5. Include a legend labelling the lines 'phase = 0' and 'phase = pi/2' as appropriate.
6. Set the limits on the axes such that we have 

$$ 0 \leq x \leq 2\pi,  \quad -1 \leq y \leq 1$$

Save the figure with the filename 'waves.png' using the plt.savefig command. 

The figure should look like this:
